An initial prototype was designed and enginered in one evening by Roman Tsisyk.
After that the library was completely rewritten, tested and documented
(which took a while).

The project exists only thanks to the excellent tracing just-in-time compiler
in `LuaJIT <http://luajit.org>`_.

The library works best with `Tarantool <http://tarantool.org>`_ --
an efficient in-memory database and Lua application server.
