This is a collection of Lua libraries for Lua 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. The
libraries are copyright by their authors 2000-2015 (see the AUTHORS
file for details), and released under the MIT license (the same
license as Lua itself). There is no warranty.

Stdlib has no prerequisites beyond a standard Lua system.


Installation
------------

The simplest way to install stdlib is with [LuaRocks][]. To install the
latest release (recommended):

    luarocks install stdlib

To install current git master (for testing):

    luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lua-stdlib/lua-stdlib/release/stdlib-git-1.rockspec

To install without LuaRocks, check out the sources from the
[repository][github], and then run the following commands: the
dependencies are listed in the dependencies entry of the file
`stdlib-rockspec.lua`. You will also need autoconf and automake.

    cd lua-stdlib
    autoreconf --force --version --install
    ./configure --prefix=INSTALLATION-ROOT-DIRECTORY
    make all check install

See [INSTALL][] for instructions for `configure`.
